A list of awesome reverse engineering tools


## Reverse Tools

- [frida](https://github.com/frida/frida) â€“ Dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse-engineers, and security researchers.

- [ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) - A software reverse engineering (SRE) suite of tools developed by NSA's Research Directorate in support of the Cybersecurity mission

- [retdec](https://retdec.com/) - RetDec is an open-source machine-code decompiler based on LLVM.

- [radare](https://www.radare.org/) - Libre and Portable Reverse Engineering Framework

- [cutter](https://github.com/radareorg/cutter) - utter is a free and open-source reverse engineering framework powered by radare2

- [PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda) - PEDA is an extension for GDB (GNU DeBugger) to help with the development of exploit code.

- [PyREBox](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/pyrebox) - PyREBox is short for Python scriptable Reverse Engineering Sandbox. It provides dynamic analysis and debugging capabilities of a running QEMU virtual machine.

- [r2frida](https://github.com/nowsecure/r2frida) - Both Radare2 and Frida have their own area of expertise. This project combines both, to allow a more extensive analysis of files and processes


## Binary analysis tools

- [BAP](https://github.com/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap) - The main purpose of BAP is to provide a toolkit for program analysis. 

- [Binary Analysis Next Generation](https://github.com/armijnhemel/binaryanalysis-ng) - BANG is a framework to unpack files recursively and scan them. The files can be firmware, binaries, or malware. The main goal is to scan all files and perform classification and labeling.

- [LIEF](https://github.com/lief-project/LIEF) - The purpose of this project is to provide a cross platform library which can parse, modify and abstract ELF, PE and MachO formats.

- [manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore) - Manticore is a symbolic execution tool for analysis of smart contracts and binaries.

- [pyelftools](https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools) - This toolkit is used by other software, or standalone. Its main purpose is to parse binary ELF files and DWARF debugging information.
